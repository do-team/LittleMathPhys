<p>AHOJ ZUZKO Click the button to display the Pi generated by Gregory and Liebnitz for
mula. Note - variable K has to be quite big, more then 1000, to have reasonable
approximation. This is definitely not usefull, but it shows, how mathematicians
had hard lives back then ;). I do NOT recommend to use this script for proper math, it's only for my own curiosity.</p>

<button onclick="GregoryPi()">Try it</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function GregoryPi()
{

var result = 0;
var k = 1000;
var i = 1;

for (i = 1; i < k; i++)
{
var l = Math.pow(-1, i+1);
var m = l / (2 * i - 1);
result = result + m;

}

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 4 * result;
}
